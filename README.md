# Product-development-for-organizing-the-transportation-of-employees-of-a-large-company
In this project, a prototype of a software system for organizing the transportation of company employees was obtained. This prototype is functional. This allows to use it as a basis of full-fledged software product which can be used in large companies with a large number of employees.

The implemented software system is based on the algorithm for constructing routes for K employees using N vehicles. This algorithm solves the multiple traveling salesman problem using a combination of k-means++ algorithm and the ant colony method.

 A convenient application of this algorithm in practice is provided by a web application with user interface for preparing initial data, execution of the algorithm, processing and presenting the results to the user. The application is built on a classic client-server architecture.  The client side is implemented in JavaScript, and the server side is implemented in Python using the Django framework.
